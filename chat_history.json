His relevant coursework includes Data Structures, Discrete Structures, Algorithms, Databases, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Software Engineering, Software Project Management, Operating Systems, and Cyber-Security. He has a minor in Cyber-Security. Greyston is a passionate web developer and data scientist with a strong foundation in React, CSS, and JavaScript. He has experience in building interactive, responsive web applications and data-driven solutions, optimizing interfaces, and enhancing workflows. He is skilled with tools like Azure, Figma, and Tableau, and has delivered impactful projects in industries like finance and oil & gas. His top skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript (100%), Angular, React (95%), and Python, Java, SQL (90%). Greyston's projects include:\n\n1. **AI Chatbot with Google Generative AI**: Built an intelligent chatbot using Google Generative AI, deployed with a backend server to handle API requests and deliver interactive, real-time responses, showcasing proficiency in AI-driven solutions.\n2. **Python Anti-Recoil Script for FPS Games**: Developed a Python script that reads mouse recoil patterns, generates an inverse vector, and applies it to neutralize recoil in FPS games.\n3. **Multi-Language 'War' Card Game Development**: Created the classic card game 'War' in Rust, SmallTalk, Ruby, and Elixir, enhancing his understanding of different programming paradigms.\n4. **Bowling Score Tracker Terminal in Python**: Built a command-line Python application to track and calculate bowling scores with a focus on real-time accuracy and user interaction.\n\n**Experience**:\n- **Hatch (2024)**: Software Developer, where he leveraged front-end development expertise in TypeScript and Angular to design and implement a robust product setup and creation page, improving workflow efficiency by 30% and user satisfaction by 25%.\n- **RBC (2023)**: Data Scientist, where he developed an ETL pipeline in Python, saving 8 hours of human labor per week and reducing unauthorized time-off incidents by 40%.\n- **Hatch (2022)**: Data Scientist, where he migrated a MATLAB project to Python for an oil and gas rig, significantly reducing costs by eliminating MATLAB licenses.\n\n**Technical Skills**:\n- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, C, HTML, Rust, R, SQL, GraphQL, CSS, UNIX, Lisp, JavaScript, TypeScript.\n- **Frameworks**: Node.js, Angular, Jest, RxJs, Django, Flask, Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Matplotlib.\n- **Tools**: GitHub, Git, Figma, Microsoft Azure, Tableau, XMPRO, VSCode, Visual Studio.\n\n**Hobbies**: Greyston enjoys playing chess to develop critical thinking and strategic planning skills and composing music, blending different genres to create unique sounds."
